		<h1 class="donateSection">Who we are</h1>
		<p>The Church of Grant is a religious movement founded by our leader and Prophet, Grant Youngs.</p>
		<p>We teach love and patience to all those that are willing to listen. We follow the direction that Grant leads us in.</p>
		
		<h1 class="donateSection">2012 Begins Our History</h1>
		<p>Our movement began in the year 2012. The Ancient Mayans predicted that the End of Times would come upon the world and end everything we know and love. This is when the Prophet Grant miraculously halted our destruction and saved the world and all its inhabitants.</p>
		<p><span>With His great wisdom, he envisioned a new world. One that would allow for peace and love and teriaki chicken for the world to be proud of.</span></p>
		
		<h1 class="donateSection">Our Core Beliefs</h1>
		<p>Our movement believes in and practices the core tenants that Grant has declared. By following these core beliefs, the world around us becomes a much more loving and happy community. The beliefs are as follows:</p>
		
		<div id="beliefs">
			<h2>First and Foremost: Don't Be a Jerk</h2>
			<p>Being rude and unkind to others is immoral and not tolerated within this Church.</p>
			
			<h2>Empathy is the Way For Me</h2>
			<p>There is too little empathy in the world today. If we as human beings and followers of Grant took the time to listen and care about others, the world would be a better place.</p>
			
			<h2>Teriaki Chicken is the Best Chicken</h2>
			<p>Don't even @ us, okay.</p>
			
			<h2>Render Unto Grant's What is Grant's</h2>
			<p>Because He cared about the world so much that he led it out of destruction in 2012, it is only fair that we give back to Him as thanks for saving us. We practice this tenant by tithing 21% of our income to the Church.</p>
